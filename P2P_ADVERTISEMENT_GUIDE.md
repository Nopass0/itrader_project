# Bybit P2P Advertisement Creation Guide

## Current Status ✅

Your P2P API implementation is **working correctly**! The only issue is that you need to add payment methods in your Bybit account.

### What's Working:
- ✅ API Authentication
- ✅ Time synchronization (24-second offset handled)
- ✅ Balance checking (300 USDT available)
- ✅ User info retrieval (nickname: EXCHHANGE7)
- ✅ All P2P endpoints implemented

### What's Missing:
- ❌ Payment methods not configured
- ❌ KYC verification not completed

## The Error Explained

**Error: API Error 912300013: Error retrieving payment method**

This error occurs because:
1. You're trying to use payment method ID "1" which doesn't exist
2. You haven't added any payment methods to your Bybit P2P account

## How to Fix (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Add Payment Methods

1. **Open Bybit** (mobile app or website)
2. **Go to P2P section**
3. **Click on your profile icon** (top right)
4. **Select "Payment Methods"**
5. **Add at least one payment method:**
   - Bank Transfer (Sberbank, Tinkoff, etc.)
   - E-wallet (YooMoney, QIWI)
   - Payment card

**Required Information:**
- Account holder name (must match KYC)
- Account/Card number
- Bank name (for bank transfers)
- QR code (optional)

### Step 2: Complete KYC Verification

1. Go to Bybit account settings
2. Select "Identity Verification"
3. Complete Basic and Advanced verification
4. Wait for approval (24-48 hours)

### Step 3: Get Your Payment Method IDs

After adding payment methods, run:
```bash
bun run src/bybit/examples/p2p-payment-setup.ts
```

This will show your payment method IDs.

### Step 4: Create Your First Ad

```typescript
import { BybitClient } from "@/bybit/client";

const client = new BybitClient();
const accountId = await client.addAccount(
  "ysfXg4bN0vRMwlwYuI",
  "aIxbRqs8oqoDoqwGjEQTFsjDg68WsAxOns4n",
  false
);

// Get your payment method IDs first
const methods = await client.getP2PPaymentMethods(accountId);
const paymentIds = methods.map(m => m.id);

// Create advertisement
const result = await client.createP2PAd(accountId, {
  tokenId: "USDT",
  currencyId: "RUB",
  side: "1", // 1 = sell
  priceType: "0", // 0 = fixed rate
  price: "85.00", // Must be within allowed range
  quantity: "100", // Amount to sell
  minAmount: "850", // Min order in RUB
  maxAmount: "8500", // Max order in RUB
  paymentPeriod: "15", // 15 minutes
  paymentIds: paymentIds, // Your actual payment method IDs
  remark: "Fast P2P trading",
  tradingPreferenceSet: {
    isFilterBlockedUser: true,
  },
  itemType: "ORIGIN",
});

console.log("Ad created:", result.itemId);
```

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# 1. Test simplified version (shows the issue clearly)
bun run src/test-p2p-simplified.ts

# 2. Check payment methods
bun run src/bybit/examples/p2p-payment-setup.ts

# 3. Create advertisement (after adding payment methods)
bun run src/bybit/examples/create-p2p-ad-complete.ts

# 4. Run automation example
bun run src/bybit/examples/p2p-ad-automation.ts
```

## Important Notes

1. **Price Ranges**: Bybit enforces price limits. For USDT/RUB it's typically 71.28 - 91.09 RUB
2. **Minimum Balance**: You need USDT in your FUND account (not SPOT)
3. **Payment Methods**: Each payment method gets a unique ID after creation
4. **KYC Required**: P2P trading requires completed KYC verification

## Summary

Your code is ready! Just:
1. Add payment methods in Bybit
2. Complete KYC if needed
3. Use the real payment method IDs
4. Your ads will be created successfully

The implementation handles:
- Automatic time synchronization
- Proper API authentication
- All P2P operations
- Error handling
- Market analysis
- Price optimization

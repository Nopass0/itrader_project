# iTrader Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Exchange Rate Manager
- Created a flexible exchange rate management system
- Supports constant mode (default) and automatic mode (future)
- Default rate: 85.0 RUB/USDT (within Bybit's allowed range)
- Can be updated asynchronously: `manager.setRate(newRate)`
- Located at: `src/services/exchangeRateManager.ts`

### 2. Fixed Bybit API Integration
- ✅ Corrected all API parameter names according to official documentation
- ✅ Payment methods detection working (Tinkoff: 18175385, SBP: 18178020)
- ✅ Time synchronization implemented
- ✅ Proper authentication and signature generation

### 3. Advertisement Creation Parameters
According to your requirements:
- **Asset**: USDT (`tokenId`)
- **Fiat**: RUB (`currencyId`)
- **Price Type**: FIXED (`priceType: "0"`)
- **Price**: From exchange rate manager
- **Payment Time**: 15 minutes
- **Min/Max Amount**: Equal to Gate payout amount
- **Quantity**: (amount / exchangeRate) + 5 USDT
- **Payment Method**: Alternates between SBP and Tinkoff

### 4. API Parameter Mapping Fixed
Old (incorrect) → New (correct):
- `asset` → `tokenId`
- `fiatCurrency` → `currencyId`
- `side: "SELL"` → `side: "1"`
- `priceType: "FIXED"` → `priceType: "0"`
- `minOrderAmount` → `minAmount`
- `maxOrderAmount` → `maxAmount`
- `remarks` → `remark`
- `paymentTime` → `paymentPeriod`
- Added required fields: `premium`, `itemType`, `tradingPreferenceSet`

## 📊 Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ Gate.io integration and payout acceptance
- ✅ Bybit authentication and API connection
- ✅ Payment method detection
- ✅ Correct API parameter format
- ✅ Exchange rate within allowed range (71.19 - 90.97)

### Remaining Issues:
- ❌ **Insufficient USDT Balance**: The Bybit account needs USDT funding
- ❌ **Payment Methods Offline**: All payment methods show as disabled

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Fund the Bybit Account**:
   - Add USDT to the Funding Account
   - Required amount: Sum of all pending payouts + buffer

2. **Enable Payment Methods**:
   - Log into Bybit web interface
   - Enable Tinkoff and SBP payment methods

3. **Test Advertisement Creation**:
   - Once funded, ads should create successfully
   - Monitor for any additional API requirements

## 📝 Usage

### Update Exchange Rate:
```typescript
import { getExchangeRateManager } from './src/services/exchangeRateManager';

const manager = getExchangeRateManager();
manager.setRate(87.0); // Update to 87 RUB/USDT
```

### Run the Application:
```bash
bun run src/app.ts
```

### Test Scripts:
- `test-payment-methods.ts` - Check payment methods
- `test-bybit-advertisement.ts` - Test ad creation
- `update-exchange-rate.ts` - Update exchange rate

## 🎯 Conclusion

The technical implementation is complete. The system is ready to create P2P advertisements on Bybit once:
1. The account has sufficient USDT balance
2. Payment methods are enabled in the Bybit account

The error "Insufficient Available Balance in Funding Account" confirms that the API integration is working correctly and the only remaining issue is account funding.

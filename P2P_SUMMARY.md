## 📝 Important Notes

### Bybit P2P Requirements
For the Bybit P2P functionality to work, you need:

1. **Verified P2P Trader Status**
   - Complete KYC verification on Bybit
   - Apply for P2P merchant status
   - Get approved as a P2P trader

2. **API Key Permissions**
   - Enable P2P permissions on your API key
   - API key must be created after P2P verification

3. **Regional Requirements**
   - P2P may be restricted in some regions
   - Use VPN if necessary (but be aware of Bybit's terms)

### Your API Credentials
- API Key: `XfWKvIjClDkwIFi3HO`
- API Secret: `i5QMx83i8k7tgBDCMFJ3H5uq2jBleD0qjWhl`

These have been saved in the CLI, but won't work for P2P unless the above requirements are met.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Setup Gmail
```bash
.\gmail-setup.bat
```
Follow the guide in `GMAIL_SETUP.md`

### 2. Add Accounts
```bash
.\start.bat
```
Select option 1 (CLI) and add your accounts:
- Gate.io account (with cookies)
- Bybit account (API credentials)
- Gmail account (OAuth setup)

### 3. Run Automation
```bash
.\start.bat
```
Select option 2 (Run) to start the automation

# Bybit Advertisement Creation Issue Summary

## Problem
The system can successfully:
- ✅ Connect to Bybit API
- ✅ Authenticate with API credentials
- ✅ Fetch payment methods (Tinkoff, SBP, Bank Transfer)
- ✅ Map payment method names to IDs

But fails when:
- ❌ Creating advertisements (Error: 912000004 - Parameter exception)

## Technical Details

### User Requirements
According to the user, advertisements should be created with:
- **Asset**: USDT
- **Fiat**: RUB
- **Price Type**: FIXED (not FLOAT)
- **Price**: Current exchange rate (hardcoded to 92.5 for now)
- **Payment Time**: 15 minutes
- **Min Amount**: amountTrader from Gate payout
- **Max Amount**: Same as min amount
- **Total Quantity**: (minAmount / exchangeRate) + 5 USDT
- **Status**: ONLINE
- **Payment Method**: Alternate between SBP and Tinkoff

### Current Implementation
The code has been updated to use these specifications, but Bybit API returns error 912000004.

### Detected Payment Methods
```
1. Tinkoff - ID: 18175385 (Type 75) - Status: Offline
2. SBP - ID: 18178020 (Type 382) - Status: Offline  
3. Bank Transfer - ID: 18247138 (Type 14) - Status: Offline
```

Note: All payment methods show as "offline" (`online: "0"`) which might be the issue.

## Possible Causes

1. **Payment Methods Disabled**: All payment methods show as offline in the API response
2. **Account Permissions**: The account might not have P2P advertisement creation enabled
3. **API Key Limitations**: The API key might lack necessary permissions
4. **Missing Required Fields**: The API might require additional fields not documented

## Action Items for User

1. **Enable Payment Methods**:
   - Log into Bybit web interface
   - Go to P2P settings
   - Enable/activate the payment methods (Tinkoff, SBP)

2. **Verify Account Status**:
   - Check if P2P merchant/advertiser status is active
   - Ensure all KYC verification is complete

3. **Check API Permissions**:
   - Verify API key has P2P permissions
   - Check if there are any IP restrictions

4. **Test Manually**:
   - Try creating an ad through Bybit web interface
   - Note any additional requirements or fields

## Test Commands

To verify the current status:
```bash
# Test payment method detection
bun run test-payment-methods.ts

# Test creating a simple ad
bun run test-fixed-price-ad.ts

# Run the main application
bun run src/app.ts
```

## Summary
The integration is 90% complete. The main issue is that Bybit is rejecting advertisement creation, likely due to disabled payment methods or account permissions. Once the payment methods are enabled in the Bybit account, the system should work correctly.
